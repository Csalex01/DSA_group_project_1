# 游닄 Bookpoint 游닄

## 游늶 Description

Bookpoint is a free and open source CLI solution for libraries.

With this tool, you can list all the available books, apply a filter on them, check for existence based on attributes, and many more!
If you are interested in a book and want to dig deeper about a publisher, writer, etc..., you can do that!

You can execute these commands using the user-friendly, easy to use, innovative and intuitive menu system, which was developed by a team of engineers and graphics designers. 

All of this could not have been possible without a whole team of psychiatrists.. believe me, they needed them.
